I would like to write a Python program that does the following:
- Align the sanger sequence results in "*.ab1" files with the reference sequence in "*.gb" files using MAFFT.
- Extract the aligned sequences from the MAFFT output.
- For each annotated features in the "*.gb" files, extract the sequences from the aligned sequences.
- Write the extracted sequences to a file with the annotated feature name and position.
Can you help me write this program?
